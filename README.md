# SQL Project
Created for a database class project. While I did have 2 other people assigned to work on the project with me, I laid down the groundwork for the database and created all the tables (as I was working alone before I was assigned to a group, though the professor told us to use my database).

The queries at the end were programmed by me, as each group was to have 10 "complex" queries to access data. My partners created the other 7, but those queries are not in this file. My partners had also added some of the entires to the tables.

"Required" planning files I wrote are included as well.
